    <p>North West-based Single Reed Specialist Kat Browning (‘Katmuss’) boasts a varied 22-year career, spanning folk, jazz, and classical music.
    <p>During her MA studies at Bangor University, Kat won the concerto competition performing as Soloist in Claude Debussy’s Première Rhapsodie for Clarinet and Orchestra, before specialising in Bass Clarinet with tutelage from the likes of Sarah Watts, Paolo de Gaspari, and Gareth Davies. 
            <br>Upon graduating from RNCM, Kat joined Theatre Alibi’s Autumn Tour of Olive & the Dream Train. She was responsible for executing an original 40-minute score, which featured Bass Clarinet, Alto Sax, keyboard, iPad (GarageBand) and loop pedal. She also toured as part of a new ‘scratch’ ensemble for new ‘verbatim’ opera Positive (by Michael Betteridge) on Clarinet and Bass Clarinet. This was performed at Manchester’s International Anthony Burgess Foundation, Folkestone Theatre and the Hackney Showrooms.</p>
    <p>In February 2020, Kat performed the Jonathan Russell Concerto for Bass Clarinet and Orchestra with the Leicestershire Sinfonia. This concerto truly explores the Bass Clarinet as a soloist’s instrument by spanning a range of four and a half octaves, as well as using multiphonics.
            <br>Drawing on her previous experiences with Theatre Alibi and 'Positive', Kat is currently exploring musical storytelling as a creative medium. Using a loop pedal and footswitch bought with her award for Instrumentalists (given generously by the Sickle Foundation of North Wales), Kat will be stepping into a seldom-explored niche of house concerts.
            <br>In order to develop the technical aspects of playing the Bass Clarinet, she will be attending the Lunenberg Academy of Music Performance in Canada in June 2020. Here she will develop her ideas with the guidance of the Academy tutor and one of the world’s leading exponents of Bass Clarinet, Sarah Watts.
    <p><a href = "https://www.helpmusicians.org.uk/creative-programme/supported-artists/katmuss" style="color:cyan;">Help Musicians UK</a> have provided funding of £1500 for Kat to attend the Lunenberg Academy for Music Performance to further hone her specialism in bass clarinet with world-renowned bass clarinettist and educator Sarah Watts, taking place between June 10th and 18th this year. Kat has also been invited to stay on to facilitate and perform for their Composition Academy the following week. With the skills learned on this course, Kat will be developing a particular story in mind, that of “Much the Cat”... Follow Kat on Facebook and Twitter
